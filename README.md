# Programming-Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the 2024 Cybersecurity Incidents & Data Breaches dataset to answer key questions about breaches across industries, attack methods, trends over time, and financial losses to companies. The goal is to identify patterns and insights that can help organizations better prepare for cybersecurity threats.

## Chosen Questions
1. Which industries suffer the most breaches?  
2. What are the most common breach methods and how do they compare in frequency?  
3. How has breach frequency changed over time?  
4. Which company lost the most money?  

## Findings

**Q1: Industry Breaches**  
This chart illustrates the frequency of cybersecurity breaches across various industries. Given the data, the technology industry has the most breaches, followed by healthcare and finance. This means that companies in technology are targeted more often and need to focus on improving their technological security.

**Q2: Common Breach Methods**  
The most popular attack techniques in 2024 are displayed in the bar graph. Ransomware is the most common type, affecting numerous businesses where hackers encrypted systems and demanded payment. Other attack types also occur but much less frequently. This indicates that ransomware is currently the biggest threat, and organizations need strong backups, fast patching, and employee training to reduce the risk.

**Q3: Breach Frequency Over Time**  
The chart shows that breaches occurred consistently, with at least one incident reported on most dates. However, as the year progressed, the number of breaches increased, indicating a growing frequency of attacks over time.

**Q4: Company Losses**  
The analysis identifies which company lost the most money due to breaches and fines, highlighting the organizations most financially impacted by cyberattacks.

## Why We Chose This Project
The Cybersecurity Incidents & Data Breaches 2024 dataset lists individual breach events with columns like company name, ransom amount, regulatory fines, and other incident details, combining text and numeric data for analysis of financial losses.  

We chose this dataset because it shows real-world data on cyberattacks, letting you see which companies lose the most money and spot trends in ransoms and fines.

## How to Run
To run this project, first navigate to the project folder on your local machine. All project files, including the Jupyter Notebook, should be included in the folder.

Next, ensure that all the files are tracked by Git by adding them to the staging area and committing them with an initial commit message. This step saves a snapshot of the project files and ensures that all necessary files are included.

The main branch should be set as the active branch to match GitHub’s default, which allows for proper version control.

Once the local repository is set up, link it to the GitHub repository by specifying the repository URL. This connection allows you to push your local files to GitHub so that others can access the project.

Finally, push the committed files to the main branch on GitHub. Once pushed, the notebook and all project files will be available on the repository, and the notebook can be opened and run using Jupyter Notebook.
